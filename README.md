Pirple NodeJS Master Class Homework Assignment #1

## Homework Assignment #1

This is the first of several homework assignments you'll receive in this course. In order to receive your certificate of completion (at the end of this course) you must complete all the assignments and receive a passing grade.

## The Assignment:

Please create a simple "Hello World" API. Meaning:

1. It should be a RESTful JSON API that listens on a port of your choice. 

### By default http on port 3000 & https on port 3443.  There is a Production mode available that runs on 8080/8443 respectively.

2. When someone posts anything to the route /hello, you should return a welcome message, in JSON format. This message can be anything you want. 

### There are three available routes:  /hello, /ping & /dts
### All three will return 200 status codes
### /hello and /dts also return JSON responses




## How to Turn It In:

1. Create a public github repo for this assignment. 

2. Create a new thread in the discussion forum and note "Homework Assignment #1" at the top of your post.

3. In that thread, discuss what you have built, and include the link to your Github repo.
